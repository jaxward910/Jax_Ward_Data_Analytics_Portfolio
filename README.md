## 🏈 Featured Projects

### 1. **NFL Playoffs Logistic Regression**
- **Goal:** Predict playoff qualification probabilities using team performance metrics.
- **Techniques:** Logistic regression, confusion matrices, and ROC/AUC analysis.
- **Key Insight:** Quantifies how early-season metrics influence postseason outcomes.
- **Tools:** `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`

---

### 2. **Pocket Clock – QB Completion % Over Expected (CPOE) vs. Time to Throw**
- **Goal:** Model how quarterback decision time impacts accuracy beyond expected completion percentage.
- **Techniques:** Simple and multiple linear regression; residual and leverage diagnostics.
- **Key Insight:** Identifies efficiency thresholds by quarterback archetype.
- **Tools:** `statsmodels`, `numpy`, `seaborn`

---

### 3. **Fantasy Running Back MLR**
- **Goal:** Forecast fantasy RB performance using rushing attempts, targets, and efficiency stats.
- **Techniques:** Multiple Linear Regression (MLR), VIF multicollinearity testing.
- **Key Insight:** Visualizes which stats most strongly drive fantasy point production.
- **Tools:** `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `sklearn`, `r2_score`

### 4. **NBA Poisson Regression & Expected Value Dashboard**
- **Goal:** Predict NBA player **Points + Rebounds + Assists (PRA)** totals using a Poisson regression model, incorporating recent game performance and betting odds.
- **Techniques:** Poisson regression, probability mass modeling, expected value (EV) calculations, interactive visualization via **Shiny**.
- **Key Insight:** Quantifies probability of hitting PRA lines and identifies positive expected value bets across players.
- **Tools:** `R`, `Shiny`, `ggplot2`, `dplyr`, `glm`  
- **Dashboard Features:**  
  - Player selection and betting line input  
  - EV calculation from American odds  
  - Visualization of predicted vs. actual PRA distributions  
  - Interactive output for exploring player trends
